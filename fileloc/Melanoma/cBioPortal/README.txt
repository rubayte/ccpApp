To test the cBioPortal we used data from a single melanoma patient (M032) treated with Vemurafenib (BRAF-V600E inh.) for which we have 6 samples: 1 Pre-treatment and 5 post treatment samples. This is a project currently in progress in the group of Daniel Peeper by Kristel Kemper and Oscar Krijgsman. 

DNA copy number data and expression data was uploaded into the cBioPortal, these files and annotation files are all present in the folder M032. This was done in collaboration with Jan Huducek. 
A little more info can be found in the powerpoint. 

Explanation on the formats is provided in the .mht files (web browser Opera can open these).
