Genetics
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Variome # Variome is the whole set of genetic variations found in populations of species that have gone through a relatively short evolution change.
For example, among humans, about 1 in every 1,200 nucleotide bases differ. However, as the human species diverged only 10,000 years ago, this variation rate is comparatively small.
In practice, the variome can be the sum of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the population.Variomics is the study of variome and a branch of bioinformatics.

Pathogenicity # Pathogenicity is the ability of a pathogen (bacterium/virus) to produce an infectious disease in an organism.

Eutherian # Eutherians are mammals that comprises the placentals.

Nosology # Classification of Human diseases.

Somatic Mutation # Cells with heterozygous mutations (one good copy of gene and one mutated copy) may function normally with the unmutated copy 
until the good copy has been spontaneously somatically mutated. This kind of mutation happens all the time in living organisms, but it is difficult to measure the rate.

Morphology # The study of the form or shape of an organism or part thereof.

Topography # The distribution of parts or features on the surface of or within an organ or organism.

Coding region # The coding region of a gene, also known as the coding sequence or CDS, is that portion of a gene's DNA or RNA, composed of exons, that codes for protein.

Non coding region # In genetics, noncoding DNA describes components of an organism's DNA sequences that do not encode for protein sequences.

Synonymous and Nonsynonymous SNP # To be a synonymous or a non-synonymous SNP, the SNP must fall inside a protein-coding region of the DNA (otherwise it is a noncoding SNP). 
A synonymous SNP is a coding SNP that does not change the protein sequence. A non-synonymous SNP is one that changes the protein sequence. 
So what you have to check is if the SNP changes a codon to a different codon for the same amino acid, in which case it is a synonymous SNP, or if it changes the codon 
to one that codes for a different amino acid, in which case it is a non-synonymous SNP.

Missense mutation # A missense mutation (a type of nonsynonymous mutation) is a point mutation in which a single nucleotide is changed, resulting in a codon that codes for 
a different amino acid. 

Nonsense mutation # Mutations that change an amino acid to a stop codon are considered nonsense mutations.

Negative selection # In natural selection, negative selection or purifying selection is the selective removal of alleles that are deleterious.

Positive selection # A selective sweep is the reduction or elimination of variation among the nucleotides in neighboring DNA of a mutation as 
the result of recent and strong positive natural selection.

Copy-number Variant # Any deletion, insertion, duplication, or other variant in the DNA sequence of a genome that results in that sequence being present in greater or lesser 
numbers relative to those seen in a normal reference genome.




Database
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Background to normalization: definitions

Functional dependency # In a given table, an attribute Y is said to have a functional dependency on a set of attributes X (written X → Y) 
if and only if each X value is associated with precisely one Y value. For example, in an "Employee" table that includes the attributes "Employee ID" and "Employee Date of Birth", 
the functional dependency {Employee ID} → {Employee Date of Birth} would hold.
It follows from the previous two sentences that each {Employee ID} is associated with precisely one {Employee Date of Birth}.

Trivial functional dependency # A trivial functional dependency is a functional dependency of an attribute on a superset of itself. {Employee ID, Employee Address} → {Employee Address} 
is trivial, as is {Employee Address} → {Employee Address}.

Full functional dependency # An attribute is fully functionally dependent on a set of attributes X if it is:
functionally dependent on X, and not functionally dependent on any proper subset of X. {Employee Address} has a functional dependency on {Employee ID, Skill}, 
but not a full functional dependency, because it is also dependent on {Employee ID}.

Transitive dependency # A transitive dependency is an indirect functional dependency, one in which X→Z only by virtue of X→Y and Y→Z.

Multivalued dependency # A multivalued dependency is a constraint according to which the presence of certain rows in a table implies the presence of certain other rows.

Join dependency # A table T is subject to a join dependency if T can always be recreated by joining multiple tables each having a subset of the attributes of T.

Superkey # A superkey is a combination of attributes that can be used to uniquely identify a database record. A table might have many superkeys.

Candidate key # A candidate key is a special subset of superkeys that do not have any extraneous information in them: it is a minimal superkey.
Examples: Imagine a table with the fields <Name>, <Age>, <SSN> and <Phone Extension>. This table has many possible superkeys. 
Three of these are <SSN>, <Phone Extension, Name> and <SSN, Name>. Of those listed, only <SSN> is a candidate key, as the others contain information not necessary to uniquely 
identify records ('SSN' here refers to Social Security Number, which is unique to each person).

Non-prime attribute # A non-prime attribute is an attribute that does not occur in any candidate key. Employee Address would be a non-prime attribute in the "Employees' Skills" table.

Prime attribute # A prime attribute, conversely, is an attribute that does occur in some candidate key.

Primary key # Most DBMSs require a table to be defined as having a single unique key, rather than a number of possible unique keys. 
A primary key is a key which the database designer has designated for this purpose.


Normal form	Defined by Brief definition:

First normal form (1NF)	# Table faithfully represents a relation and has no repeating groups
Second normal form (2NF) # No non-prime attribute in the table is functionally dependent on a proper subset of any candidate key
Third normal form (3NF)	# Every non-prime attribute is non-transitively dependent on every candidate key in the table
